          <p>
            WATER IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL RESOURCES ON EARTH, YET IT IS
            INCREASINGLY BECOMING SCARCE DUE TO RISING GLOBAL POPULATIONS,
            CLIMATE CHANGE, AND POOR WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. AS THE WORLD
            FACES CHALLENGES OF WATER CONSERVATION, INNOVATIVE APPROACHES LIKE
            WEB-BASED GAMES ARE GAINING ATTENTION. THESE GAMES OFTEN ADOPT
            ENGAGING AND EDUCATIONAL THEMES, SIMULATE REAL-WORLD WATER
            MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS, AND ENCOURAGE PLAYERS TO ADOPT SUSTAINABLE
            WATER-SAVING HABITS AND MINDFUL PRACTICES REGARDING ITS USE. THROUGH
            INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCES, GAMES CAN INSTILL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
            TOWARDS WATER CONSERVATION IN PLAYERS, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER
            GENERATION.

          <h2>About The Game</h2>
          <p>
            WaterSense is a session-based maze arcade game where users can
            either take on the role of an educator to create game sessions and
            invite students to participate. Flo, the water-efficiency hero,
            embarks on a mission to save water by navigating through water pipes
            and answering questions about water conservation. However, it must
            avoid the Water Wastersâ€”nasty monsters symbolizing bad water habits.
